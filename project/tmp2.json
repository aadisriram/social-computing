I am a rising Junior here at NC State! \n\nSave My Semester is a new website that was created by college students, for college students. Our objective is to help students make some pocket money online while still saving the leftover money Mom and Dad gave you, all while staying successful in the classroom and staying sane with a social life. We are launching the website in August.\n\nCurrently, we are looking for students to bring on board for this growing movement! We are looking for creative writers and bloggers who are passionate about writing, as well as interested or experienced in our industry. Any background in English, Communications, or Marketing would be awesome, but not required!\n\nThis position will consist of research of article topics and brands, as well as writing on said topics in a conversational style to engage our readers. You will work closely with our team throughout the semester! \n\nIf you feel like this is a position you may be interested in and want some extra money for the weekends, feel free to contact Kyle May at kyle.may\u0040savemysemester.com and he can help you get started on an application! \n\nI Hope to see some of you on the Save My Semester Team soon!","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/197403883710758\/posts\/588115114639631"},{"name":"Like","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/197403883710758\/posts\/588115114639631"},{"name":"Create Group Chat","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/197403883710758\/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2014-07-13T19:59:13+0000","updated_time":"2014-07-13T19:59:13+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10152394784337940","name":"Kyle Ashley Beuchot"},{"id":"10200883195400509","name":"Adam Cartagena"},{"id":"847834931914905","name":"Michael Thomas"},{"id":"1566105893603768","name":"Bethany Kendall"},{"id":"10152601119097051","name":"Ashwin Rajan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAxNTI2MDExMTkwOTcwNTE=","before":"MTAxNTIzOTQ3ODQzMzc5NDA="}}}},{"id":"197403883710758_587605298023946","from":{"name":"Judy Sisouvong","id":"10203140710093028"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Jobs & Internships","privacy":"OPEN","id":"197403883710758"}]},"message":"Hey guys!

Looking for people that are either experienced servers or good at multitasking and keeping cool when it gets really busy. Servers should be sociable and are encouraged to get to know customers since most of our dine in business is with regular customers.\nDriver: duties include assisting kitchen staff with preparation and dishes when they aren't out on deliveries, as well as of course taking deliveries. We are looking for someone that works well with others (you'll be spending most of your time back in the kitchen and it can be pretty hectic), a quick learner, and is good at following directions.\nHours for both positions are flexible. The application process is simple, and we are looking to hire someone immediately for both positions. If you have questions, you can message me or comment.\nApplication process: call the restaurant, tell them you are interested in the position, and ask to be able to come in and have an interview with Thomas (manager).  Best times to come in are between 2-4 ( business is slowest in these hours). Bring a copy of your resume with you to the interview. And, if you get the position you'll get a call from the manager soon after, or if you make a really good impression he may start talking hours with you before you leave the interview.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/197403883710758\/posts\/566967080087768"},{"name":"Like","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/197403883710758\/posts\/566967080087768"},{"name":"Create Group Chat","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/197403883710758\/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2014-06-02T20:30:41+0000","updated_time":"2014-06-04T00:04:55+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"comments":{"data":[{"id":"567026463415163","from":{"name":"BG Moua","id":"816099045086648"},"message":"Choua Lee","message_tags":[{"id":"773355679341263","name":"Choua Lee","type":"user","offset":0,"length":9}],"can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-06-02T21:19:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"567084770075999","from":{"name":"Stephen Schneider","id":"10203004801954108"},"message":"What is the pay?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-06-02T22:51:37+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"567856986665444","from":{"name":"Tara Beck","id":"10203015290757945"},"message":"Hey, Rose Anthony how many hours a week is that server position?","message_tags":[{"id":"517918274983395","name":"Rose Anthony","type":"user","offset":5,"length":12}],"can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-06-03T22:11:24+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"567867736664369","from":{"name":"Rose Anthony","id":"517918274983395"},"message":"$7.25 plus tips, unless you're making more than 7.25 an hr in tips, in which case the hourly pay will drop to 2.50","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-06-03T22:50:24+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"567901679994308","from":{"name":"Emily Hoffman","id":"10152394010694395"},"message":"So, if I get a 50 cent tip my pay is going to drop to 3?

Here is a note from an HR manager:\n\nI have two programs that are forming.  One is for some graduates to work for our organization over here for a little while and learn everything about our business on this side of the water.  Then go over to China and work with that side of the business over there, and probably stay there.  They may or may not go back and forth.  The other program is to hire people from here to go work over there.  It would be great if they speak Mandarin and English.  We have a real lack of Chinese speaking people who understand our culture over here.  We want people who want to start at the beginning, learn our whole business and grow with the company.  They will learn the business side\/the sales and marketing side and then the manufacturing side.  Let me know if you have questions and what they may be.  This will help us form our program.
