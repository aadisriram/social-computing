I am leading a group of students to South Africa for a 4 week volunteer program in wildlife conservation. While in South Africa students will work with nonprofit wildlife rehabilitation and rescue centers. Students will have the opportunity to assist with camera trapping, biodiversity surveys, species counts, center maintenance, animal enrichment\/feeding, and education. Students will also learn about local ecology, human animal interactions, and about anti-poaching and other conservation efforts.  This is an amazing chance to experience South African culture and learn more about international conservation efforts.  This program would be great for anyone interested in conservation, education, or nonprofits. This is a very hands on learning experience. At the end of volunteering we will participate in some exciting tours. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in learning more or joining the trip! We will be traveling from the end of May through June.  You can get academic credit or internship credits through this program at the approval of your academic adviser. \n","picture":"https:\/\/external.xx.fbcdn.net\/safe_image.php?d=AQD3R05qvqXhIdQo&w=130&h=130&url=https\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fwww.isvolunteers.org\u00252Fblog\u00252Fwp-content\u00252Fuploads\u00252F2015\u00252F09\u00252FNaitve-Nature-1024x489.jpg&cfs=1","link":"http:\/\/www.isvolunteers.org\/destination\/south-africa\/volunteer-projects","name":"Volunteer Projects in South Africa | ISVolunteers","caption":"isvolunteers.org","description":"ISV\u2019s South Africa Volunteer Projects are focused on wildlife conservation, children\u2019s program through community developments, and environmental management.","icon":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/images\/icons\/post.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/197403883710758\/posts\/833800843404389"},{"name":"Like","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/197403883710758\/posts\/833800843404389"},{"name":"Create Group Chat","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/197403883710758\/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"link","status_type":"shared_story","created_time":"2015-10-19T19:38:24+0000","updated_time":"2015-10-19T19:38:24+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10203556218802171","name":"Milica Lakobrija"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAyMDM1NTYyMTg4MDIxNzE=","before":"MTAyMDM1NTYyMTg4MDIxNzE="}}}},{"id":"197403883710758_831767566941050","from":{"name":"Laura GK","id":"780477381962394"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"Jobs & Internships","privacy":"OPEN","id":"197403883710758"}]},"message":"Hey Wolfpack,\nWe need you help for a project, could you please answer our survey.\nIt will only take you about 2 mins...
