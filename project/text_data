It can be tempting to put in as much overtime as possible — answering emails at 11:00p.m., dropping by the office on the weekend — but not giving yourself any time off is sure to lead to burnout. Remember: just because you  can  work all the time doesn\'t mean you  should .  \n    Find a mentor .  One of the best ways to navigate the workforce is to align yourself with a mentor. Finding and developing a professional relationship with someone more experienced than you can be a great resource when you\'re first starting out  and  a huge benefit down the line in your career when you need someone to vouch for you.

     'Hey guys! I was chosen to be a designer in a fashion show coming up called "Couture for a Cause." This is a fundraising event to benefit Activate Good, which is a group that pairs with other local, non-profits and volunteers to promote support and business for all. This event brings in over 500 guests and is quite a show! We (local designers) are competing for a chance to win a prize in Couture Ready-to-Wear categories, but it means so much more to me than that. I am not majoring in design or textiles (I wish I had-hindsight is 20/20) but I am a Business Marketing major who just happens to have a serious love for fashion and design (it\'s what I want to do for a career), and I\'m already shocked and honored that I was even selected to contribute compete as a designer! At the end of the runway show, the pieces we have created are auctioned off and the proceeds go towards the cause each designer has been paired with. I have been paired with AniMall, a rescue organization that finds homes for all types of homeless animals-not just cats and dogs! They are located at Cary Towne Center and I recently (before I even knew about this design competition) adopted my two furry little soul mates (that\'s exactly what they are to me:)) from AniMall, so it really does mean so much to me to be participating in so many ways!\n\nPoint of my post (so sorry this was so extensive): I am in need of someone to actually sew my ensembles for me. I have to put together two full outfits and can acquire all of the materials necessary, but the actual process of assembling is a bit lost on me! My mom and aunt can sew very well, but they are in Charlotte so they can only help so much! This would be a great learning opportunity and a substantial and credible event that you can add your resume for experience, volunteerism, and involvement! Not to mention, this is for a great cause-not for me, but for all of the organizations that are participating and involved...they really are all so unique and their stories and missions are touching.\n\nPlease let me know if you or ANYONE you know would be willing to help me in any way. I promise we will make it fun, I can bake yummy snacks and treats for fuel and compensation! Both of these ensembles must be made by November 1, but the fashion show is not until November 15. And you do not need to be at either event if you don\'t want to come. I know this is a very short frame of time, but I just found this out less than a week ago and have been sorting out the logistics of it since! I can email you the sketches of the outfits also and the descriptions of them, as well.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this, I\'m sorry it was so much info!\n\nIn case you are interested, here is the website for the event: http://activategood.org/coutureforacause/\nAnd for Animall: http://www.animall.org/\nAnd the FB page for Couture for a Cause: https://www.facebook.com/activategood.coutureforacause/photos_stream' ],
