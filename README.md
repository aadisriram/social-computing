To calculate betweenness centrality, number of nodes, number of edges and clustering coefficient we need to run the program "prog_1.py". To do this, make sure the files folder which is part of this submission is copied as is to the location of the python file. Once this is done type in "python prog_1.py". The processing takes a while but once it finished it will return a result similar to the one mentioned in the project report.

For each of the hypothesis 1,2 and 3, there are separate code files named p101, p102 and p103 respectively. Run these files by typing "python <name_of_file>", make sure the files folder has been copied as is from the submission. All output from these programs which in this case are in the form of csv are put into a folder called output on successful run. Open the files in excel or your favorite spreadsheet application. To generate the plots, select the second and third columns and click on insert data table > Scatter Plot. This will generate images similar to the ones that have been added as part of the report.
